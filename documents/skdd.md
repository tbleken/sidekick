## DD (DoDefault builder)

In a method in the Form Designer or the Class Editor, a Dodefault() call must include the same parameters as the method accepts. This tool automatically adds the correct parameter list.

| You type:                |        Result after pressing ![`F8`](Images/F8.png)          |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| dd                     | A DeDefault statement is added including all required parameters|
 
**Note 1:** This tool only works in the Class Editor or Form Designer.

**Note 2:** In this documentation ![`F8`](Images/F8.png) is consistently used as this hotkey for `Sidekick`. It can easily be changed by using one of [Thor's](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) tools.
