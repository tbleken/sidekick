## List all registered Thor tools, with incremental search 

**Note:** In this documentation ![`F8`](Images/F8.png) is consistently used as this hotkey for `Sidekick`. It can easily be changed by using one of [Thor's](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) tools. 


| You type:                |        Result after pressing ![`F8`](Images/F8.png)|

The list has incremental search to narrow the selection. Pick the wanted tool, and press **Enter** to run it. 

**Note:** some tools may not be relevant from where you are in the IDE, in which case the tool won't start, or you will get a warning or an error.
