## `SX` (ShelleXecute)

This command gives you a quick way to run external applications or execute files.

Easy to use: type `sx xxx` and press ![`F8`](Images/F8.png).   
Replace `xxx` with the name of the application or file.  
Unless specified, `.com`, `.exe` or `.bat` is expected as file extension.

Some samples:  

| You type:  | After pressing ![`F8`](Images/F8.png)|
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sx cmd` | DOS command window is opened |
| `sx excel` | Excel is opened |
| `sx myfile.bat 123`| `myfile.bat` is started with `123` as parameters |
| `sx myfile 123`| Same as above |


**Note:** In this documentation ![`F8`](Images/F8.png) is consistently used as the hotkey for `Sidekick`. It can easily be changed by using one of [Thor's](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) tools.
