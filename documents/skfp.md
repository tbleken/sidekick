## `FP` (Field Picker)

### Open SuperBrowse as a field picker for SQL statements.  

**Note:** In this documentation ![`F8`](Images/F8.png) is consistently used as the hotkey for `Sidekick`. It can easily be changed by using one of [Thor's](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) tools. 

| You type:                |        Result after pressing ![`F8`](Images/F8.png)|
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Fp` | SuperBrowse opens the currently selected table or cursor. If none is selected, you get a list |
| `FP ?` | SuperBrowse shows list of all tables in the path |  
| `FP xxx` | SuperBrowse opens with table with `xxxx` in the name |  

If more than one file match the specified parameter, you will see a list to pick from.

Select the fields and options you need, and press `Apply`.
