## `Menu` (or `?`)

This "command" shows a list of all the `Sidekick` tools that are relevant from where in the IDE you are.

Select the option you want, and press `Enter`.  

**Note:** In this documentation ![`F8`](Images/F8.png) is consistently used as the hotkey for `Sidekick`. It can easily be changed by using one of [Thor's](https://github.com/VFPX/Thor) tools.
