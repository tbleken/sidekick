### 2025-10-02, Version 1.32

New command [FF (Find File)](documents/skff.md), used to locate file in any folder below the current one, and optionally copy its full path and name into the clipboard. 

New command [FL (File Lister)](documents/skfl.md). Lists all the matching files in the current folder and path, and optionally copies its full path and name into the clipboard. Accepts wild cards, `*` and `?`. 

Enhanced behavior of Sidekick's [Menu](documents/skmnu.md) command. Now all personal extensions are listed unless you use the optional command `??`. See [the documentation](documents/skmnu.md) for details.  

More features added to the [BR](documents/skbr.md) command. See [Help on BR](documents/skbr.md) for details.  

Added an alternative Thor starter program for `Sidekick`, `thor_tool_sidekickmenu.prg`. For details, check [How Sidekick works](documents/skhow.md).  

### 2025-09-24, Version 1.31

**Important**: Changed name of command `pr` into `gr` since `pr` was misleading. This command refers to groups within project files, and not the project files themselves.

`Ins` command (`+`): Added the possibility to read methods from form files (`.scx`) and class libraries (`.vcx`). See [Insert](documents/skins.md) for details.

### 2025-09-10, Version 1.30

Mostly bug fixes and minor changes.  

**Important**: It has been necessary to remove some commands from `ed` and move them into a new command `op`, short for `Open`. This means that the variants that works with `Sidekick's` MRU list, `SKMRUList.dbf` by default, are now called with `op`.  
A positive "side effect" of this change is that the new code is much shorter and easier to maintain. Unfortunately, a few minor changes to the syntax have been necessary.

### 2025-08-14, Version 1.25

Some bugs have been fixed.  

New command [ER (Error)](documents/skerr.md) is implemented. This command will show details about the last generated error in a grid.  

Added the possibility to override `Sidekick's` features. For instance if you don't like the functionality of the command `br`, you create `sk_br.prg`. `Sidekick` will find this file, and run it instead of the built in function. See [Create your own Sidekick extensions](documents/skext.md) for more.

Necessary changes have been done to make sure that most of `SideKick's` commands can be run from an inputbox when the cursor is on a blank line or over the desktop.  

A nice side effect of this is that you in many situations get an "emergency exit". For instance if you can't access the command window because your program is running, you can press the dedicated `SideKick` key, type `Cancel` followed by `Enter`. Or `Set Step On` to activate the Debugger. Or `clear event` and similar commands.

### 2025-07-31, Version 1.21
Fixed a long lasting bug in the grids which made PgDn and PgUp behave "strangely". 

### 2025-07-30, Version 1.20
This version includes a complete remake of how SideKick separates the different "commands" into designated methods. Earlier this was done in a series of Case statements. The new routine involves a "Factory model" which makes maintenance much easier.  

One side effect of this new model, is that it's not necessary to have a space between a `Sidekick` "command" and the first parameter.  

The [TA (Test area)](documents/skta.md) tool has been vastly improved, and several options has been added. Over all, this has been a much more appealing feature. See [the documentation](documents/skta.md) for more.  



### 2025-07-04, Version 1.05
Added option to the `EC` command, making it possible to execute commands when the Command Window is not available. Super handy for instance when your code hangs.

### 2025-07-03, Version 1.04
More minor bug fixes.

### 2025-07-01, Version 1.03
Minor bug fixes.

### 2025-07-01, Version 1.02

Minor bug fixes. Added code to set defaults when run before it's configured.
Added `Sidekick.sk` file as a sample `Sidekick` project file.

### 2025-06-30, Version 1.00 First version released to the public.

All documentation is synchronized.
